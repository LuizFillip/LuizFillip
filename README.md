## GreetingsðŸ‘‹  :alien:


I have a degree in physics from the Universidade Estadual da ParaÃ­ba (UEPB) and a master's degree in physics from the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), two institutions located in Campina Grande-PB, Brazil. My first contact with the Python programming and data analysis occurred during graduation when i started my scientific initiation project. Currently, I am P.h.D candidate at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) at SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos-SP. My research area, space physics, encompasses ionosphere-thermosphere coupling, ionospheric irregularities (e.g., Equatorial Plasma Bubbles, EPBs) and atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs).

This repository aims to share some projects involving the analysis of data collected by different space weather instruments monitoring, numerical analysis implementation and coding challenges.
