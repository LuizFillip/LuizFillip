# **Welcome to My Space Physics Repository** 🚀  

Hello there!  

I specialize in **space physics**, with a strong background in ionosphere-thermosphere interactions and **Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs)**. I earned my **Bachelor's degree in Physics** from the State University of Paraíba (UEPB), followed by a **Master’s degree in Physics** from the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), and a **Ph.D.** from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) in São José dos Campos, Brazil.  

This repository contains a collection of **data analysis projects** focused on **space weather monitoring**, **numerical methods**, and **geophysical modeling**.
