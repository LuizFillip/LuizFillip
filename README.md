# Greetings

I am Luiz Fillip, a passionate physicist with a focus on space physics. I hold a degree in Physics from the State University of Paraiba (UEPB) and completed my Master's degree in Physics at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the prestigious National Institute for Space Research (INPE) in São José dos Campos-SP, Brazil. My research area revolves around space physics, particularly exploring ionosphere-thermosphere coupling, ionospheric irregularities, and atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs). I also specialize in geophysical data analysis.

# Data Analysis Projects
In this repository, you will find a collection of data analysis projects related to space weather monitoring and numerical methods. Here are some of the exciting projects you can explore:

## Space Weather Monitoring

- [Digisonde](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Digisonde): A pipeline for analyzing reduced data and DRIFT-X measurements (doppler technique) obtained from digisonde instruments. The pipeline provides valuable insights into virtual height, critical frequencies, and other parameters.

- [Fabry-Perot](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Fabry-Perot): This pipeline focuses on the analysis of temperature and neutral winds measured by a Fabry-Perot interferometer, providing essential data for atmospheric studies.

- [Magnetometers](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Magnetometers): In this project, we analyze and process data from magnetometers, which provide valuable information about geomagnetic field components.

- [Geophysical Indexes](https://github.com/LuizFillip/PlanetaryIndices): Explore planetary disturbance indexes, including geomagnetic and solar indicators, through informative visualizations and plots.

- [Imager](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Imager): Dive into the fascinating world of all-sky images processing for a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric phenomena.

- [GEO](https://github.com/LuizFillip/GEO): Gain insights into basic attributes in geophysics, including mapping, terminators, and geomagnetic lines.

- [Aeronomy-plotting](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Aeronomy-plots): Explore various data correlation, timeseries, seasonality, and other plot types for different models and instruments in the field of aeronomy.

- [Aeronomy-models](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Aeronomy-models): Dive into the world of modeled geophysical data (IRI-16, HWM-14, and MSISE-00) and gain valuable insights into atmospheric phenomena.

- [Aeronomy-Equations](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Ionosphere):  This pipeline focuses on the numerical calculus of ionospheric and atmospheric parameters.

## Tools

- [RINEXplorer](https://github.com/LuizFillip/RINEXplorer): Read rinex and sp3 files and get observables for to compute TEC and ionospheric parameters

## Coding 
 - [WebSacrape](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Webscrape): Learn how to use the Request and BeautifulSoup libraries for web scraping geophysical data from various websites.
 - [CodeWars](https://github.com/LuizFillip/CodeWars):Explore coding kata challenges from Code Wars, a platform to improve coding skills through real coding exercises.
 - [Numerical Methods](https://github.com/LuizFillip/NumericalMethods): See  Fourier Interpolation, Least-Squares implemantion and others
 - [Junk Code](https://github.com/LuizFillip/JunkCode): Engage in Python coding exercises and challenges to enhance your coding skills and problem-solving abilities.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you find the projects here both inspiring and informative!
