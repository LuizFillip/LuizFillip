## GreetingsðŸ‘‹  :alien:


I have a degree in physics from the Universidade Estadual da ParaÃ­ba (UEPB) and a master's degree in physics from the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), two institutions located in Campina Grande-PB, Brazil. Currently, I am P.h.D candidate at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) at SÃ£o JosÃ© dos Campos-SP. My research area, space physics, encompasses ionosphere-thermosphere coupling, ionospheric irregularities (e.g., Equatorial Plasma Bubbles, EPBs) and atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs). Since then, I have been specializing in geophysical data analysis with Python language.

This repository aims to share some projects involving the analysis of data collected by different space weather instruments monitoring, numerical analysis implementation and coding challenges.
