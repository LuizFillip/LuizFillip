# Greetings :ghost:
I'm an enthusiastic physicist specializing in space physics. I graduated with a Physics degree from the State University of Paraiba (UEPB) and pursued my Master's degree in Physics at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. at the esteemed National Institute for Space Research (INPE) in São José dos Campos-SP, Brazil. My research focuses on space physics, specifically delving into ionosphere-thermosphere interactions, studying Equatorial Plasma Bubbles (EPBs).

In this repository, you will find a collection of data analysis projects related to space weather monitoring and numerical methods. Here are some of the exciting projects you can explore:

## Space Weather Projects

- [Digisonde](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Digisonde): A pipeline for analyzing reduced data and DRIFT-X measurements (doppler technique) obtained from digisonde instruments. The pipeline provides valuable insights into virtual height, critical frequencies, and other parameters.
- [Fabry-Perot](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Fabry-Perot): This pipeline focuses on the analysis of temperature and neutral winds measured by a Fabry-Perot interferometer.
- [Magnetometers](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Magnetometers): In this project, we analyze and process data from EMBRACE magnetometers.
- [Geophysical Indexes](https://github.com/LuizFillip/PlanetaryIndices): Explore planetary disturbance indexes, including geomagnetic and solar indicators, through informative visualizations and plots.
- [Imager](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Imager): Dive into the fascinating world of all-sky images processing for a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric phenomena.
- [GEO](https://github.com/LuizFillip/GEO): Gain insights into basic attributes in geophysics, including mapping, terminators, and geomagnetic lines.
- [GOES](https://github.com/LuizFillip/GOES): Extract informations about deep convective storms.
- [DataFetch](https://github.com/LuizFillip/DataFetch): Copy and replacing data across repositories.
- [Aeronomy-plotting](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Aeronomy-plots): Explore various data correlation, timeseries, seasonality, and other plot types for different models and instruments in the field of aeronomy.
- [Aeronomy-models](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Aeronomy-models): Dive into the world of modeled geophysical data (IRI-16, HWM-14, and MSISE-00) and gain valuable insights into atmospheric phenomena.
- [Aeronomy-Equations](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Ionosphere): This pipeline is centered on the numerical calculation of ionospheric and atmospheric parameters.

## Tools

- [RINEXplorer](https://github.com/LuizFillip/RINEXplorer): Retrieve data from Rinex and SP3 files to obtain observables for the purpose of computing Total Electron Content (TEC) and ionospheric parameters.

## Coding 
 - [Webscrape](https://github.com/LuizFillip/Webscrape): Learn how to use the Request and BeautifulSoup libraries for web scraping geophysical data from various websites.
 - [CodeWars](https://github.com/LuizFillip/CodeWars):Explore coding kata challenges from Code Wars, a platform to improve coding skills through real coding exercises.
 - [Numerical Methods](https://github.com/LuizFillip/NumericalMethods): See  Fourier Interpolation, Least-Squares implemantion and others
