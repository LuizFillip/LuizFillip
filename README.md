# About Me

Hello, fellow enthusiasts! I am Luiz Fillip, a passionate physicist with a focus on space physics. I hold a degree in Physics from the State University of Paraiba (UEPB) and completed my Master's degree in Physics at 
the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the prestigious National Institute for Space Research (INPE) in São José dos Campos-SP, Brazil. My research area revolves around space physics, particularly exploring ionosphere-thermosphere coupling, ionospheric irregularities, and atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs). I also specialize in geophysical data analysis.

# Data Analysis Projects
